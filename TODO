Refactor:
----------
1. In kubernetes,
    - a pod might have multiple services.
    - a pod might not have any services.
    - We might have multiple ip addresses and container ids.
2. In docker,
    - no matter how many publishes we make, theres only one host.
    - There might be multiple ports.

3. So now, what we do is, we return back publish information as well.
4. Lets implement the kubernetes logic first and then move that over to docker.



6. Return many containerid, containernetwork, containerport for each publish info in docker as well.
7. Add wait for ip address logic in kubernetes.
8. Add container network to stop and delete containers as well.

NOTE: 
    - Only one port can be mapped to one container port.
    - Eg: 2222 and 2223 cannot be mapped to 22.
    - So 2222:22 and 2223:23 should be done. 2222:22 and 2223:22 is not supported.
