Tomorrow:
---------
1. Delete browseterm docker container.
2. Delete test_ssh docker container.
3. Rebuild image and Repush
4. Run docker container.
5. Check logs for runtime environment.
6. Run in kubernetes.
7. Check logs for runtime environment. /.dockerenv should not be present.


Refactor:
----------
1. Get runtime env to work for both docker and k8s
2. Do not take cnenv from request. Rather, select the env on your own.
3. Get the optional keys from the request. Make them have default values.
    - For example, publish and environment details may not be present.
